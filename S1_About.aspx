            About Us

At CrowdFeed, we are a subsidiary of ProSensors, a sensor manufacturing company founded by Mr. David Sanchez in the early 2000s. Our team of intrapreneurs had a vision to create an advanced proximity capacitive sensor that would detect seat occupancy and ease the stress of finding available seats, especially during peak hours in shopping mall outlets.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe that our solution will bring significant benefits not only to our users but also to our clients. This proposal will ease stress, enhance brand awareness, and improve perceptions of shopping malls. At CrowdFeed, we are dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of individuals and creating a more efficient and stress-free shopping mall experience.
        </p>
